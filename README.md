## Abstract

This project enhances the predictive accuracy of machine learning models on the MNIST dataset through advanced feature extraction, data augmentation, and hyper-parameter tuning. The optimized models achieved up to 98.29% accuracy.

## Methods

### Radon Transform
- **Linear SVM Accuracy:** 83%
- **Quadratic SVM Accuracy:** 96%

### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
- **KNN Accuracy:** 94.6%
- **Linear SVM Accuracy:** 95.65%
- **Quadratic SVM Accuracy:** 96.84%
- **With Augmentation:** 96.89%

### Image Patches
- **KNN Accuracy:** 96.9%
- **Quadratic SVM Accuracy:** 97.3%
- **With Augmentation:** 97.9%

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Quadratic SVM Accuracy:** 98.075%
- **With Augmentation:** 98.29%

## Conclusion

Advanced feature extraction, data augmentation, and hyper-parameter tuning significantly improved the MNIST digit recognition accuracy. Future work could apply these methods to other datasets and explore more advanced techniques.
